# Choose between 5 diffent emotions and get a randmome bible text, that will encourage you.
# I enjoy reading the Bible, this idea came from using popcycle sticks with scriptures written on the each side.
# After you grab a wooden popcycle stick, you would see a scripture reference that you could read for the day, week etc...

# 2 Things I would like to add.
# 
# First, I would like to add SMS messages to this app in the future. I already have a Twilio project that displays this possibility.
# 
# Second, I want to make this into a web app, containerize it and deploy on Ec2 with AWS.
